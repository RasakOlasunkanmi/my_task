For example, enzymes often exhibit stereospecificity in their interactions with substrates, meaning that they will only bind to substrates of a particular stereochemistry. This is crucial for the enzyme's catalytic function, as the shape of the active site is complementary to the specific substrate.\n",

      "Additionally, the nature of the weak interactions (such as hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions) that stabilize these biomolecular interactions also contributes to their stereospecificity.

      "Amino acids play crucial roles in various biological processes, including the formation of proteins through peptide bonds, where the carboxyl group of one amino acid reacts with the amino group of another, releasing water in a condensation reaction. The sequence and composition of amino acids in a protein determine its structure and function.\n",

      "🔍 Agent: [Calling retrieval tool...]\n",
      "🤖 Agent: The relationship between DNA, proteins, and amino acids is fundamental to the processes of genetics and biochemistry. Here’s a breakdown of how these components interact:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)**: DNA is the genetic material that contains the instructions for building proteins. It is composed of sequences of nucleotides, each consisting of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The sequence of these bases encodes the information necessary for the synthesis of proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Proteins**: Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in biological systems. They are made up of long chains of amino acids, which are linked together by peptide bonds. The specific sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the corresponding sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Amino Acids**: Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. There are 20 different amino acids that can be combined in various sequences to form proteins. Each amino acid has a specific side chain that determines its properties and role in the protein structure. The genetic code in DNA specifies which amino acids are to be used in protein synthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process of protein synthesis involves two main steps:\n",
      "- **Transcription**: The DNA sequence of a gene is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA carries the genetic information from the nucleus to the ribosome, where proteins are synthesized.\n",
      "- **Translation**: The mRNA is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids, forming a polypeptide chain that folds into a functional protein. Each set of three nucleotides (codon) in the mRNA corresponds to a specific amino acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, DNA provides the blueprint for proteins, proteins are made up of amino acids, and the sequence of amino acids is dictated by the sequence of nucleotides in DNA. This relationship is crucial for the functioning of cells and the expression of genetic traits.\n",
