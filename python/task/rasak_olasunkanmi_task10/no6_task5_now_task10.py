# Task6: Attendance Tracker
# - Write a Python program that;
# Step 1 - Stores the days of the week in a tuple.
# Step 2 - Stores the months of the year in another tuple.
# Step 3 - Asks the user to enter:
# Step 4 - Studentâ€™s name
# Step 5 - Gender
# Step 6 - Course Track
# Step 7 - Current month number (1-12)
# Step 8 - Current day number (1-7)
